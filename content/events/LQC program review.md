The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO), in partnership with NSA’s Laboratory for Physical
Sciences (LPS), invites you to the LPS Qubit Collaboratory (LQC) Program Review (LQCPR),
taking place on April 4 & 5, 2022 in College Park, MD.

This working meeting will provide the opportunity for our collaboration partners to convene,
provide research updates, discuss future research directions and strategize the pathway to
tackle the hardest technical challenges. The LQCPR is a great opportunity to network and
explore potential collaborations with LQC, which is, after all, a collaboratory.
LQC is one of thirteen national quantum information science research centers. LQC
was launched in November 2020 to pursue disruptive research into building qubits for
quantum computers, innovative workforce development programs, and deep, collaborative
partnerships to tackle some of the hardest open problems in quantum information science
and technology.
