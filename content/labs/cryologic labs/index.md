# Reversible Logic

Macroscopic-quantum phenomena with flux-quanta are explored to lower the energy usage of digital gates in computers. Present-day logic gates use irreversible functions, but physics allows for fundamentally more-efficient reversible gates. Free-dynamical reversible gates are possible using systems of undamped Josephson junctions with complex resonances. Ongoing theoretical and experimental studies of these resonances may lead to dissipationless changes in flux-quanta polarity for the future of computing.

LPS supports the [IARPA Supercables](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/supercables) program.

>The focus in the SuperCables program is demonstration of components to convert from low level electrical signals in circuits operating at a temperature of approximately 4 kelvins to conventional optical signals at room temperature. Pending results of this program, IARPA may support a follow-on program to develop the complete system for data transmission between room temperature and 4 kelvins.
