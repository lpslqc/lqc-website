Our primary focus is the development of novel materials and technologies for quantum computer research.  Motivated by our previous theoretical work on silicon quantum computer architectures, we are exploring novel approaches to creating semiconductor devices at the atomic scale: we have fabricated and measured the first silicon field effect transistor (FET) devices in which mobile electrons are confined adjacent to a hydrogen terminated silicon surface. These devices have record mobility and exhibit the sixfold valley degeneracy expected on silicon [111].  We have recently extended this technique to hole systems and have observed the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in a very high mobility electron device. In a separate project, we are applying the technologies being developed for ion trap quantum computing to isolate and characterize flakes of levitated spinning graphene.
