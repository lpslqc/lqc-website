## 2021 Overview ##

A recap of the 2021 workshop is available [here]({{< relref "news/Summer of Quantum recap" >}}).

The Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) Qubit Collaboratory (LQC) is hosting a Summer of Quantum Workshop for rising undergraduate seniors and graduate students enrolled in physics and engineering programs. Leading quantum scientists will provide a two-week introduction to quantum computing from algorithms to physical implementations. The workshop will include quantum tutorials, interactive, hands-on projects, and virtual lab tours. The goal of the workshop is to provide an onramp for interested students into quantum information science.  Registration is limited!  Apply before the June 15th Deadline.

- **Dates:**  July 12 â€“ 23, 2021
- **Location:**  Online via Zoom.
- **Times:**  Afternoons 1-5pm EST
