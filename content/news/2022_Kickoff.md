# Hello and Happy New Year! 

The year 2020 marked the inception of the LPS Qubit Collaboratory. As we look forward to a 2022 filled with more great research, let’s take this opportunity to review some of what we have accomplished together already in 2021. 

# About the LQC
From conception, [we envisioned](https://www.qubitcollaboratory.org/news/lps-announces-first-ever-qubit-collaboratory/) the LQC as a new model for a National QIS research center in support of the [National Quantum Initiative](https://www.quantum.com/). Building on the over two-decades of both internal and sponsored research programs in quantum computing at LPS, the [LQC’s mission](https://www.qubitcollaboratory.org/about/how-the-lps-qubit-collaboratory-works/) is to accelerate disruptive qubit research, create innovative workforce development programs, and establish deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle some of the hardest [open problems](https://www.qubitcollaboratory.org/engage/lqc-open-baa/) in quantum information science and technology. 

# Ways to Join and Partner With Us
[We are actively hiring](https://www.qubitcollaboratory.org/people/lqc-open-positions/) new researchers at LPS and dramatically upgrading the fabrication and measurement infrastructure at the lab. We’ve expanded and created new student and postdoc LPS fellowship programs in conjunction with University of Maryland’s Joint Quantum Institute, Condensed Matter Theory Center, Quantum Materials Center, Quantum Technology Center, and MIT’s Center for Quantum Engineering Bedard Fellows. We extended the LPS/ARO QuaCR program to postdocs and welcomed the first cohort of Summer of Quantum visitors. The entry point of working with the LQC is the [ARO/LPS LQC BAA](https://www.qubitcollaboratory.org/engage/lqc-open-baa/), which allows for collaborative research between government, industry, national labs, and academic partners to pursue hard problems together - and inspired our [symbol](https://www.qubitcollaboratory.org/about/about-the-lps-qubit-collaboratory/). 

It’s a new model, different from how DARPA, DOE, or NSF sponsors research programs, so it’s worth reviewing how it works. Everything is made possible by the innovative ARO BAA, which not only allows for collaborative research, but also provides sabbaticals and visits to LPS (or vice versa), and a year-long opportunity to apply for Quantum Computing Research (QuACR) fellowships for U.S. citizen graduate students and postdocs. At the heart of the LQC are the Research Thrusts. While they may be updated over time, LPS scientists and program managers have written them to reflect some of the outstanding, long-term opportunities and challenges in our field. Our goal is to find people to partner with to tackle these problems. So, if these challenges resonate with you, and you think your skill sets match well with ours to help make progress, consider working with us by:
1.	Reading the BAA,
2.	Talking to us, and/or
3.	Submitting a White Paper. 

The BAA is designed so that we can talk and evolve a research plan together in a collaborative fashion and work to secure funding for an incubator used to flush out a multi-year research collaboratory proposal. This is entirely different from the traditional funding model where researchers submit proposals to secure funding to work on their own ideas. If you already have an idea for an independent research project, your proposal is more suitable for a traditional funding model (LPS Sponsored Research, IARPA, DARPA, etc). We are all learning in this new model - it very much is an experiment. So one way we are educating ourselves and others is by hosting workshops pertaining to each of the research thrusts. The first workshop, entitled Workshop on Gaps in Postsecondary Quantum Education and Training, addressed the accelerated learning research thrust. This workshop resulted in a number of new ideas and conversations that are on the path to funding through the BAA.

# Thank Yous
Before we share some additional accomplishments below, we would like to extend a big thank you to all the researchers, speakers, and guests who have joined us this past year. Finally, we would like to send a special thank you to the students, postdocs, and visiting professors who attended our Summer of Quantum activities. Enjoy reading about some of our accomplishments below. 

# LQC Accomplishment Highlights

## Events
●	**Summer of Quantum Workshop**: The LQC hosted its inaugural, free, Summer of Quantum Workshop July 12-23, 2021. Fifty-four (54) national and international participants received an introduction to quantum computing from algorithms to physical implementations, including quantum tutorials and interactive, hands-on projects led by leading quantum scientists from LPS and beyond.

●	**Workshop on Quantum Recruitment in Government**: On August 30, 2021, the LQC co-hosted with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy,  a workshop on Quantum Recruitment in Government with approximately forty participants, representing a variety of government agencies, federally funded research and development centers, and a university affiliated research center.

●	**Workshop on Gaps in Postsecondary Quantum Education and Training**: On October 12, 2021, the LQC hosted a free, virtual, public Workshop on Gaps in Postsecondary Quantum Education and Training. There were over a hundred registrants, speakers, and panelists including representatives from academia, industry, and government.
