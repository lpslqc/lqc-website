The Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) hosted a workshop on Quantum Recruitment in Government with approximately forty participants, representing a variety of government agencies, federally funded research and development centers, and a university affiliated research center.  Speakers discussed their recruitment activities in quantum information science (QIS) and how successful these are. Challenges in recruitment and retainment were highlighted, and a panel of government hiring experts revealed what is being done to address these challenges. A panel also shared their personal journeys into government careers. The workshop ended on an optimistic note, with a sense that the hiring challenges are solvable, and the US can maintain its leadership in QIS.
