The Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) Qubit Collaboratory (LQC) hosted its inaugural, free Summer of Quantum Workshop July 12 – 23, 2021. Fifty-four (54) national and international participants an received introduction to quantum computing from algorithms to physical implementations, including quantum tutorials and interactive, hands-on projects led by leading quantum scientists from LPS and beyond. On average, all participants improved their proficiency in quantum information science skills. According to an attendee, “This [was] an exceptional workshop. The virtual challenge was handled brilliantly.” The workshop organizers look forward to hosting an even better workshop next year.
