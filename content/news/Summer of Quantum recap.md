This summer, from July 12 - 23, 2021, the Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) Qubit Collaboratory (LQC) hosted its inaugural, free Summer of Quantum Workshop for rising undergraduate seniors and graduate students enrolled in physics and engineering programs. ​With the goal of providing an onramp into quantum information science, the workshop provided a 2-week introduction to quantum computing from algorithms to physical implementations, including quantum tutorials and interactive, hands-on projects led by leading quantum scientists from LPS and beyond. According to Dr. Christopher Richardson, who spearheaded and conceptualized this workshop, "Quote from Chris R here."

In order to prioritize safety for all during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Summer of Quantum Workshop was offered virtually at no cost to participants. While this eliminated in-person visits to LPS, it did provide the opportunity to extend admission to non-local participants. This first inaugural workshop offering boasted fifty-four (54) admitted participants representing thirteen (13) states within the United States as well as five (5) countries internationally. Participants also enjoyed several opportunities to network with the QIS researchers and each other, which should enable them to take these connections they made within the workshop with them as they continue their academic and professional endeavors.

In addition to improving their proficiency across each of the thirty-one (31) workshop learning objectives, on average participants experienced an increase in self-efficacy within quantum information science by 24.6% (up from their initial average of 34.5% efficacious to 61.1% efficacious on a scale of 0%-100%). For their work and commitment to the workshop, participants received Certificates of Participation signed by Dr. Richardson. As with any inaugural event, especially one that was initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were lots of lessons learned. However, the participant feedback was very encouraging. Here's a snapshot of what some of the participants shared about their experience:

- "This has been a great experience...Well done to the team."
- "The lectures were great and the discussion of the article was very rich. I enjoyed everything a lot."
- "It is great to hear the opinions of different experts in a sequence so we can form a bigger picture of what is happening in the quantum information community. Their career advice was also valuable, especially when I was in the breakout rooms with each instructor."
- "This has been an exceptional workshop. The virtual challenge was handled brilliantly."
- "I appreciated the amount of discussion of experimental applications."
- 
We look forward to making next year's workshop even better!
